    "By June 2020, the unemployment rate rose up to 13.5% in Vancouver according to the Vancouver Economic Commission. BC’s gdp alone was estimated to have a 5.1% decline. This would lead to lower economic well-being. If unemployment carries on for people with little to no disposable income, there is a possibility that they will resort to economic crimes. When unemployment increases by 1%, property crime is predicted to rise by 2% (Lin, 2008 as cited in Freeman, 1995; Bushway and Reuter 2002; Levitt, 2004). We wanted to see if that was the case in Vancouver. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set we are using includes the “type” of crime, “year,” “month,” and “neighbourhood.” We will be contrasting the mean monthly occurrences of economic criminal activities before and during the pandemic using the dataset “Vancouver Crime Data.” Our independent variables are the year and months. We are assessing two or more categories: Neighborhood and  Type of crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be focusing on “economic crimes” which are the four types of theft reported in the data set: 1) Theft FROM vehicle 2) Theft OF vehicle 3) Theft of bicycle 4) other theft. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the measure “mean” to observe what's central to the observations or what a typical crime rate of theft looks like during the pandemic and determine if it is more than the pre-pandemic years."

    "We expect to find that the crime rate increases during the pandemic compared to previous years (H1). If this alternate hypothesis is proved to be reasonable, we think it was because of the high unemployment rate and deteriorating economic situation due to the pandemic. Thus the number of cases of economic crimes would increase significantly. However, this assumption might also be incorrect since there were less activities outside because of the pandemic. However, we still think the “deteriorating economy” has a more significant impact on the crime rate than the “less activities”. So we expect to see the crime rate went up during the pandemic."

Our research is only an observational study that tries to answer whether the crime rate changes during the pandemic and we are not trying to explain the reason behind it.  More correlational study can be done on this topic so that we could gain a deeper understanding on social, economical and other factors and their relationships with crime. "
